        <h2>What is corewar ?</h2>
        <p>CoreWar is a programming game in which two or more computer programs compete for control of a virtual machine called MARS, which stands for Memory Array Redcode Simulator.</p>
        <p>These programs are written in an assembly language called Redcode.</p>
        <p>The goal of the game is to terminate all instances of the opposing program(s) in order to be the last one to execute.</p>

        <h2>How to play ?</h2>
        <p>On the current website, you can choose your champions in the form of ".s" files.</p>
        <p>You can modify your champions using the "edit" mode, which allows you to make changes. I encourage you to explore it and discover its features on your own.</p>
        <p>Once you have chosen your champions, you simply need to launch the game.</p>
        <p>A window of your terminal will be displayed, and the game is built using CSFML.</p>

        <h2>Its history</h2>
        <p>The idea for Core War originated from Creeper and Reaper, the first computer worms created in the early 1970s by Bob Thomas and Ray Tomlinson.</p>
        <p>The game originally formed part of a larger game called Darwin, developed by Victor A. Vyssotsky, Robert Morris Sr., and M. Douglas McIlroy at Bell Labs in the 1960s.</p>
        <p>The term "core" derives from the technology of magnetic core memory, which was used at the time. It refers to the small magnetic rings, or cores, used to store data in early computers. The term "core dump" in computer jargon also has the same origin, referring to the process of dumping the contents of memory for debugging or analysis purposes.</p>
